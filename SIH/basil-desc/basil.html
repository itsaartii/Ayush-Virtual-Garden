<h3>
    Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a painful condition where stomach acid travels up the esophagus and causes heartburn. Aloe vera may help with reflux by lowering inflammation in the esophagus and reducing stomach acid. One early study suggested that aloe vera syrup worked as well as reflux medications such as ranitidine (Zantac) and omeprazole (Prilosec) but with fewer side effects.

<h1>Aloe vera for IBS symptoms</h1> 
<h3> Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) causes symptoms such as diarrhea and belly pain. Studies have linked IBS to an imbalance of good and bad bacteria in the gut. Aloe may help with IBS by improving this balance, and by reducing inflammation in the intestines.
                  
                  
                  
    In one study, people with IBS who took an herbal supplement containing aloe vera and other ingredients for 4 weeks had less constipation, diarrhea, belly pain, and gas. Other people with IBS who drank aloe vera juice said some of their symptoms improved. Because a few studies have shown no benefit, scientists need to do more research on aloe vera for IBS.
    
    The results of aloe vera studies for other medical conditions have been less clear.</h3>
