        <h1>What Is Lemon?</h1>
  <h3>
    Lemon is a citrus fruit widely used in culinary applications for its tart and acidic flavor. The lemon tree is considered native to Asia, and lemons were first cultivated in China or India. Lemons were then introduced to the Mediterranean region by Arab traders, and they eventually made their way to Europe and the Americas.

Today, lemons are grown in warm climates worldwide, including in California, Italy, Greece, Mexico, India, and Argentina. In the United States, California produces the majority of lemons.
<br> <br>
Lemons are small, oval-shaped citrus fruits with a thin, yellow peel and sour, acidic flesh. A large central cavity inside the lemon contains 5 to 6 seeds.

The lemon tree grows to a height of 20 feet (6 meters) and has evergreen leaves that are dark green and glossy. The tree produces white five petaled flowers that have a strong fragrance.

Lemons are thought to be a cross between two other citrus fruits: the lime and the citron. Lemons were first mentioned in literature in a 9th-century Arabic book and were also mentioned by Italian writer Giovanni Francesco Ferrari in 1493.
